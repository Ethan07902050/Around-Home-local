This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Get Started

### Set Your Google API Key

You have to create a `key.js` file under the `/src` folder, and write the following code:

```
const API_KEY = {YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY};
export default API_KEY;
```

Otherwise you can't use the Google API.

### Yarn

Type the following command in CMD

```
yarn
yarn start
```

and the app will run the [local host in port 3000](http://localhost:3000) for you.
